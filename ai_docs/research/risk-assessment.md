## High-Risk Items (Score: 28-64)

### 1. Vendor Lock-in and Dependency
**Risk Score**: 45 (Impact: 5, Probability: 3, Exposure: 3)

#### Description
Heavy dependence on external embedding providers (Voyage AI, OpenAI) creates vulnerability to service disruptions, pricing changes, and policy modifications.

#### Specific Concerns
- **API Deprecation**: Provider may discontinue specific models
- **Pricing Volatility**: Sudden price increases affect operational costs
- **Service Availability**: Outages directly impact system functionality
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Provider may restrict access to certain regions

#### Potential Impact
```
Service disruption scenarios:
- Complete outage: 100% system unavailability
- Rate limiting: 50-80% performance degradation
- Price increase: 200-500% cost inflation
- Model deprecation: 3-6 months forced migration
```

#### Current Mitigation
- Circuit breaker patterns for API failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Basic error handling and logging

#### Recommended Enhanced Mitigation
```python
# Multi-provider embedding strategy
class MultiProviderEmbeddingEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = {
            'primary': VoyageAIProvider(),
            'secondary': OpenAIProvider(), 
            'fallback': LocalModelProvider()
        }
        
    async def generate_embedding(self, text):
        for provider_name, provider in self.providers.items():
            try:
                return await provider.embed(text)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"{provider_name} failed: {e}")
                continue
        raise AllProvidersFailedException()
```

#### Timeline for Mitigation
- **Immediate (Sprint 2)**: Implement secondary provider
- **Short-term (Sprint 3)**: Local model fallback
- **Medium-term (6 months)**: Full multi-provider architecture

### 2. Performance Scaling Limitations
**Risk Score**: 40 (Impact: 4, Probability: 4, Exposure: 2.5)

#### Description
System may not meet performance requirements as data volume and user concurrency scale beyond current projections.

#### Specific Performance Risks
- **Query Latency Degradation**: p95 latency exceeds 50ms target
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Qdrant memory usage grows beyond server capacity
- **I/O Bottlenecks**: Storage throughput limits batch processing
- **Concurrent User Limits**: System becomes unstable above 100 concurrent users

#### Historical Performance Data
```
Observed scaling patterns:
Vector Count vs Latency:
- 1M vectors: 18ms p95
- 10M vectors: 35ms p95  
- 50M vectors: 89ms p95 (exceeds target)

Memory Usage Growth:
- Linear growth: 3.2GB per 10M vectors
- Server capacity: 32GB (limit at ~90M vectors)
```

#### Early Warning Indicators
- p95 latency > 40ms (80% of threshold)
- Memory usage > 80% of available
- Query failure rate > 0.1%
- Index rebuild time > 30 minutes

#### Mitigation Strategy
```yaml
Performance Monitoring:
  - Real-time latency tracking
  - Memory usage alerts at 70%
  - Automated load testing weekly
  
Scaling Preparation:
  - Horizontal scaling architecture
  - Index sharding implementation
  - Cache layer optimization
  - Query optimization framework
```

### 3. Compliance and Data Protection Gaps
**Risk Score**: 36 (Impact: 4, Probability: 3, Exposure: 3)

#### Description
Current system lacks comprehensive data protection measures required for GDPR, HIPAA, and enterprise compliance.

#### Compliance Gaps
```
GDPR Requirements:
❌ Data subject access rights
❌ Right to be forgotten  
❌ Consent management
❌ Data processing audit trails
❌ Cross-border data transfer controls

HIPAA Requirements:  
❌ PHI identification and encryption
❌ Access audit logging
❌ Business associate agreements
❌ Breach notification procedures
❌ Administrative safeguards

Enterprise Security:
❌ Role-based access control
❌ Field-level encryption
❌ Data classification framework
❌ Incident response procedures
```

#### Regulatory Exposure
- **GDPR Fines**: Up to €20M or 4% of annual revenue
- **HIPAA Violations**: $100-$50,000 per violation, up to $1.5M annually
- **Enterprise Deal Loss**: 60-80% of enterprises require compliance certification

#### Immediate Compliance Actions
```python
# Phase 1: Basic PII Protection
class PIIDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.analyzer = presidio_analyzer.AnalyzerEngine()
        
    def scan_document(self, text):
        results = self.analyzer.analyze(text)
        pii_types = [r.entity_type for r in results]
        return {
            'has_pii': len(results) > 0,
            'pii_types': pii_types,
            'confidence': max([r.confidence_score for r in results]) if results else 0
        }

# Phase 2: Data Subject Rights
class DataSubjectRights:
    async def handle_access_request(self, user_id):
        # Retrieve all user data across vector store
        pass
        
    async def handle_deletion_request(self, user_id):
        # Remove all user vectors and metadata
        pass
```
