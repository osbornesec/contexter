**Improvement**: Add section on integration testing gotchas and system-wide failure scenarios

#### Incomplete Cost Optimization Gotchas ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Gap  
**Assessment**: While API rate limiting is covered, broader cost management gotchas could be expanded
**Impact**: Low - Cost issues are operational rather than technical failures
**Improvement**: Add cost monitoring and optimization gotchas for cloud deployments

#### Missing Disaster Recovery Scenarios ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Gap
**Assessment**: Individual component recovery is covered but system-wide disaster recovery is limited
**Impact**: Low - Covered in deployment PRP but could be cross-referenced
**Improvement**: Add references to disaster recovery procedures and data backup gotchas

### Technical Accuracy Assessment

#### Code Examples ‚úÖ Accurate
- All Python code examples use correct async/await patterns

**Current**: Basic API key exposure and injection vulnerabilities covered
**Missing**: Container security, network policy gotchas, authentication bypass scenarios
**Priority**: Medium - Security is critical but well-documented elsewhere

#### Operational Gotchas üîç Partially Addressed  
**Current**: Memory leaks, performance degradation covered
**Missing**: Log management, backup verification, capacity planning edge cases
**Priority**: Low - Operational concerns are environment-specific

#### Development Workflow Gotchas üîç Not Addressed
**Current**: Focus on runtime and production issues
**Missing**: CI/CD pipeline failures, dependency conflicts, environment setup issues
**Priority**: Low - Development workflow is outside PRP scope

## Conclusion

The gotcha documentation successfully achieves its primary objective of identifying critical implementation challenges and providing actionable mitigation strategies. The comprehensive coverage across all system components, combined with practical code examples and production-ready configurations, makes this a valuable resource for the development team.

The evidence-based approach, leveraging both technical documentation and real-world experience, ensures the identified gotchas are relevant and likely to occur. The structured format enables both proactive prevention during development and reactive troubleshooting during operations.
