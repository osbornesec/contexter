```python
# Example validation completeness (PROXY-001)
Level 1: Unit Testing
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Connection pool management  
- Proxy rotation algorithms
- Health check mechanisms

Level 2: Integration Testing
- BrightData API interaction
- Error recovery scenarios
- Performance under load
- Memory leak detection

Level 3: Performance Testing
- Connection establishment times (<2s)
- Failover response times (<5s)
- Concurrent connection handling (50+ simultaneous)
- Memory usage optimization (<100MB for 1000 proxies)
```

**Testing Strategy Completeness**:
