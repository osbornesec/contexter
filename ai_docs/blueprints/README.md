## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
1. **Development Environment**: Python 3.9+, Docker, Git
2. **External Services**: Qdrant, Redis, Voyage AI API key
3. **Team Size**: Minimum 3 developers for optimal parallelization

### Week 1 Kickoff (Foundation Layer)
```bash
# 1. Setup development environment
git checkout -b rag-foundation-layer
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Create RAG module structure
mkdir -p src/contexter/rag/{vector_db,storage,embedding}
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,performance}/rag

# 3. Start with VDB-001: Qdrant Client Integration
# Follow detailed steps in task-execution-guide.md

# 4. Parallel development tracks:
# - Developer 1: VDB-001 → VDB-002 → VDB-006
# - Developer 2: STG-001 → STG-002 → STG-003  
# - Developer 3: EMB-001 → EMB-004 → EMB-007
```

### Key Success Metrics
- **Foundation Layer**: Sub-50ms vector search, >60% storage compression
- **Processing Pipeline**: >1000 docs/min ingestion, >95% search accuracy
- **Production Ready**: 99.9% availability, zero-downtime deployments

## Implementation Strategy

### Phased Development Approach
1. **Foundation First**: Build robust data layer before processing
2. **Parallel Development**: Maximize team efficiency with independent tracks
3. **Continuous Integration**: Validate each component as it's built
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Integrate components progressively

### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Unit Testing**: >90% coverage requirement for all components
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline validation
- **Performance Testing**: Automated benchmarking against targets
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: HNSW tuning, API rate limits, search quality
- **Integration Risks**: Component dependencies, data consistency
- **Operational Risks**: Deployment complexity, resource constraints

## Technology Stack

### Core Components
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant with HNSW indexing
- **Embedding Service**: Voyage AI voyage-code-3 model
- **Storage Layer**: SQLite + gzip compression
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with async support
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with blue-green deployment
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform with environment management

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Minimum**: 3 developers for 8 weeks (144 developer-days)
- **Optimal**: 4-5 developers with parallel track specialization
- **Skills**: Python async, vector databases, ML systems, K8s

### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Local Qdrant, Redis, development API keys
- **Staging**: Cloud-hosted services, realistic data volumes
- **Production**: Auto-scaling cluster, monitoring stack

## Expected Outcomes

### System Capabilities
- **Search Performance**: p95 <50ms, p99 <100ms latency
- **Processing Throughput**: >1000 documents/minute ingestion
- **Accuracy**: >95% recall@10 for technical documentation
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with auto-scaling

### Business Value
